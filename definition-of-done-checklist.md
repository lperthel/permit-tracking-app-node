# Definition of Done - All Issues

This checklist ensures consistent quality and government-ready standards across all development work. Every issue must meet these criteria before being marked "Done" and moved to "🚀 Sprint Complete".

---

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### **Test Coverage**
- [ ] Test coverage >90% for new features and modifications
- [ ] Unit tests for all service layer methods
- [ ] Integration test for each new API endpoint
- [ ] All tests pass locally before PR submission
- [ ] No test files skipped or ignored without documented reason

### **API Endpoint Testing**
- [ ] Integration test covers complete HTTP request/response flow
- [ ] Test cases include success scenarios (200, 201, 204)
- [ ] Test cases include error scenarios (400, 404, 409, etc.)
- [ ] Edge cases and boundary conditions tested
- [ ] Business rule validation tested where applicable

### **Frontend Testing**
- [ ] Component unit tests for new Angular components
- [ ] E2E tests updated for new user workflows
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- [ ] Accessibility testing completed (axe-core, manual keyboard navigation)

---

## 💻 Code Quality

### **Government-Ready Standards**
- [ ] All hardcoded strings extracted to `final String` constants
- [ ] No sensitive data logged (only IDs, statuses, non-PII)
- [ ] Input validation implemented with `@Valid` annotations
- [ ] Error messages are generic (no sensitive information exposure)
- [ ] DTO pattern enforced (never expose entities directly)

### **Security & Validation**
- [ ] All user inputs validated server-side
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention through proper input sanitization
- [ ] CORS configuration reviewed and appropriate
- [ ] Authentication/authorization patterns followed (when applicable)

### **Error Handling**
- [ ] `@ControllerAdvice` used for global exception handling
- [ ] Meaningful HTTP status codes returned
- [ ] Consistent error response format
- [ ] Manual error responses documented with reasoning
- [ ] Graceful degradation for non-critical failures

---

## 📖 Documentation

### **API Documentation**
- [ ] Swagger/OpenAPI annotations added for new endpoints
- [ ] Request/response schemas documented with examples
- [ ] HTTP status codes documented for each endpoint
- [ ] Business rules and validation constraints documented
- [ ] Error response formats documented

### **Code Documentation**
- [ ] Class-level comments explain role and interactions
- [ ] Public method comments include purpose, inputs/outputs, exceptions
- [ ] Inline comments for complex business logic
- [ ] Security-related code thoroughly commented
- [ ] Non-obvious algorithms or patterns explained

### **Project Documentation**
- [ ] README updated if new setup steps or commands added
- [ ] Environment variables documented if new config added
- [ ] Architecture decisions recorded for significant changes
- [ ] API breaking changes noted for frontend integration

---

## 🔧 Integration Requirements

### **API Integration**
- [ ] Postman collection updated with new/modified endpoints
- [ ] CORS configuration supports frontend integration
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration externalized
- [ ] Database migrations tested and documented
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained (or breaking changes documented)

### **Frontend-Backend Integration**
- [ ] Angular services updated to use new API endpoints
- [ ] Error handling implemented for API failures
- [ ] Loading states provided for better user experience
- [ ] Mock data updated to match real API responses
- [ ] E2E tests work with integrated backend

---

## 🏗️ Build & Deployment

### **Build Requirements**
- [ ] Maven build succeeds (`./mvnw clean verify`)
- [ ] No compilation warnings or errors
- [ ] All dependencies properly declared in `pom.xml`
- [ ] Build fails if any test fails (Surefire + Failsafe configured)
- [ ] JaCoCo coverage reports generated successfully

### **Environment Compatibility**
- [ ] Application starts successfully in development profile
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns 200 OK
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully on clean database
- [ ] Environment variables properly externalized
- [ ] No hardcoded environment-specific values

---

## 📋 Sprint-Specific Requirements

### **Sprint Demo Readiness**
- [ ] Feature is demonstrable via Postman or browser
- [ ] Demo scenarios documented and tested
- [ ] Feature integrates properly with existing functionality
- [ ] No critical bugs that prevent demo
- [ ] Stakeholder-facing documentation updated

### **Government Compliance**
- [ ] Code follows FISMA-minded security practices
- [ ] Audit trail considerations implemented where applicable
- [ ] Data validation follows government standards
- [ ] Error handling meets enterprise requirements
- [ ] Performance considerations appropriate for government workloads

## ✅ Issue Completion Checklist

Before moving any issue to "Done":

1. **Developer Self-Review**
   - [ ] All acceptance criteria met
   - [ ] All items in this Definition of Done completed
   - [ ] Code reviewed for government compliance standards
   - [ ] Local testing completed successfully

2. **Code Review** (if applicable)
   - [ ] Peer review completed for security-sensitive code
   - [ ] Architectural decisions validated
   - [ ] Government standards compliance verified

3. **Integration Validation**
   - [ ] Feature works with existing system components
   - [ ] No regressions introduced to existing functionality
   - [ ] API contracts maintained or properly versioned

4. **Documentation Complete**
   - [ ] All documentation requirements above satisfied
   - [ ] Issue description updated with final implementation notes
   - [ ] Next issue dependencies identified and documented

## 🎯 Quality Gates

**No issue can be marked "Done" unless:**
- ✅ All testing requirements met
- ✅ All code quality standards met  
- ✅ All documentation requirements met
- ✅ All integration requirements met
- ✅ Sprint demo functionality verified

**Remember**: Government-ready software requires higher standards than typical commercial development. These requirements ensure we maintain that quality bar consistently across all sprints.

> **Note**: This Definition of Done may be updated based on lessons learned during sprint execution. Any changes should be documented and communicated to the development team.
