ISSUE GENERATION CONTEXT:
Generate a GitHub issue for the permit tracking app using this format:
Scope: Day-long issues are fine if cohesive
Detail Level: Brief paragraph + bullets, avoid redundancy with existing docs
Reference Strategy: Reference project.md/test docs instead of repeating specs
Audience: Future me in 6 months + portfolio documentation
Testing: Explicitly call out test scenarios
Process: Show proper government project methodology
Required Sections:

Brief context paragraph
Dependencies & sequence analysis
Code Impact Analysis: Which existing classes need modification, what new classes to create, where files should live
Explicit test scenarios
Acceptance criteria (bullets)
Definition of Done

Stop Conditions: If something important needs documentation that doesn't exist, halt issue generation and identify what docs need creation first.
