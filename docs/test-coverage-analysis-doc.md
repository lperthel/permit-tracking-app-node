# Test Coverage Analysis

**Generated**: December 2024  
**Sprint**: 0 - Frontend Completion

## Overview

Testing strategy analysis for government-ready application standards. Service layer has excellent coverage (100%), components tested via E2E workflows.

## Karma Unit Test Coverage

### Summary

- **Statements**: 62.5% | **Branches**: 100% | **Functions**: 0% | **Lines**: 57.14%

### Coverage by Component

| Component                 | Statements     | Functions    | Status       |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| **Services**              | 100% (104/104) | 100% (38/38) | ✅ Excellent |
| **Models/Constants**      | 100%           | 100%         | ✅ Complete  |
| **Permit-form-model**     | 53% (9/17)     | 0% (0/5)     | ⚠️ Partial   |
| **Permit-form component** | 3% (1/32)      | 0% (0/10)    | ❌ Low       |
| **All-permits page**      | 46% (28/61)    | 5% (1/20)    | ❌ Low       |
| **New-permit page**       | 4% (1/28)      | 0% (0/8)     | ❌ Low       |
| **Update-permit page**    | Not tested     | Not tested   | ❌ Missing   |

## Testing Strategy Assessment

### Current Approach

- **Service Layer**: Comprehensive unit testing (100% coverage)
- **User Workflows**: E2E testing via Cypress
- **Components**: E2E coverage only (no unit tests)

### Why This Works

- Business logic isolated in well-tested services
- Components are primarily presentation layer
- E2E tests validate real user workflows
- Appropriate for government compliance requirements

## E2E Coverage Gaps (Cypress)

### Current Coverage

✅ Happy path workflows  
✅ Form Validation submission  
✅ Navigation between pages
✅ Basic network errors and recovery pages
✅ Empty datasets


### Missing Coverage

❌ **Browser Refresh during operations** - tests how the app responds during various phases of the app where the user hits "refresh"
❌ **Cross-Page Navigation** - handle how page navigation works e.g. how back/forward buttons works, when pagination resets after operations, etc.
❌ **Accessiblity** - ARIA-lables, cursors reset tests, alerts, etc.
❌ **Data intergity** - concurrent updates

## Technical Setup

### Karma Unit Tests

```bash
npm run test:coverage
open coverage/index.html
```

### Cypress E2E Tests

```bash
ng e2e
```

**Note**: Automated E2E coverage blocked by Istanbul/Babel configuration conflict. Manual analysis used instead.

---

## Recommendations

### Future Considerations

- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Component unit tests (if complexity increases)
- See "Missing Coverage" above.

---

## Conclusion

**Strategy**: Service-layer unit testing + comprehensive E2E testing  
**Status**: Service foundation excellent, E2E gaps identified  
**Next**: Complete integration coverage for standards
